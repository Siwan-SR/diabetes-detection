# Diabetes Detection model

A machine learning model that predicts whether a patient has diabetes through a series of given data.

## Data

The data is from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set

## How the model was made

The model was made using [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) an excellent machine learning library. I used Naive Bayes as the model.

## How the notebook is structured

* Explore the data
* Visualize our data
* Fit and instantiate the mode;
* Describe our model

### What you will find

* Awesome Graphs that visualize the data
* Use of [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
* Use of Scikit-Learn's manu features
* A ROC Curve
* Visual Confusion Matrix
* A custom Classification Report
